# 🚀 Selenium Automation Framework (Java + Cucumber)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a scalable Selenium Automation Framework built using Java, Cucumber (BDD), TestNG, and Maven.
It follows industry best practices and is designed for maintainable, reusable, and CI/CD-ready automation testing.

The framework automates end-to-end functional testing of the SauceDemo application with support for multi-environment execution and Allure reporting.

## 🧪 Test Coverage
- Login (positive & negative scenarios)
- Add to Cart functionality
- Checkout flow
- Logout functionality
- Data-driven testing using Scenario Outline and DataTables

## 🏷️ Tag-Based Execution
Run specific test sets using tags:

mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke"
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@regression"
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@logout"

---

## 🌍 Environment Execution
Run tests against different environments:

mvn test -Denv=qa
mvn test -Denv=uat

Environment details are visible inside Allure reports.

---

## 📊 Allure Reporting
Allure report provides:
- Step-wise execution
- Screenshots on failure
- Environment & execution metadata
- Tester information

Generate report locally:

allure serve target/allure-results

## 🔍 SonarQube Code Quality
- SonarQube ensures high code quality by providing:
- Quality Gate validation to prevent blocker and critical issues
- Code smell and duplication detection
- Maintainability and reliability analysis
- Security hotspot identification
- Technical debt tracking

## 🔁 CI/CD Integration
- Automated execution on push and pull requests
- Headless execution via GitHub Actions
- Allure report published using GitHub Pages
